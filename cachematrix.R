## Caching the Inverse of a Matrix:
## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some 
## benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly.
## Below are a pair of functions that are used to create a special object that 
## stores a matrix and caches its inverse.

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

# makeCacheMatrix creates a list containing a function to
# 1. set the value of the matrix
# 2. get the value of the matrix
# 3. set the value of inverse of the matrix
# 4. get the value of inverse of the matrix


makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  Inv <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    Inv <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(inverse) Inv <<- inverse
  getinverse <- function() Inv
  list(set = set,
       get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" created by 
## makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the 
## matrix has not changed), then it should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

# This function assumes that the matrix is always invertible.


cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  Inv <- x$getinverse()
  if (!is.null(Inv)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(Inv)
  }
  matrix <- x$get()
  Inv <- solve(matrix, ...)
  x$setinverse(Inv)
  Inv
}
